# Word Shower

A zen little game where you stare at your screen and come up with words from a transient stream of letters.

Play it [here](https://luciavelasco.github.io/word-shower/).

## Rules

- letters tumble down the screen
- while a letter is on the screen you can type it to add it to your word
- you can backspace to remove a letter, but once you do you won't be able to get it back unless it comes back in the falling letters
- click enter to submit your word, if it's a valid word it'll be added to your score, at a point per letter

There's no timer and no pressure.

## Ideas

### Touchscreen/select support

Rather than typing, select from the letters falling on screen.

Add a backspace button so that the user doesn't need to use the keyboard/input, and remove the autofocus on the input. 

### Timed mode (tbc)

Try to get as many words before your time runs out!

### Life mode (tbc)

- you have three lives
- if you ~type a letter that isn't on the screen or~ submit a word that isn't recognised you'll lose a life

If you submit 4 invalid words, you lose!

_this probably isn't a great way to do it because my library might not be complete_




###### Game idea 2

Falling words, type in the whole word before it falls off the screen. Something about themes (related words = streak with x2/x3/xN pts? Or only type words related to a theme? Or only type words that are falling in a red bubble? Idk)
