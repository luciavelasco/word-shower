# Word Shower

## Rules

- letters tumble down the screen
- while a letter is on the screen you can type it to add it to your word
- you can backspace to remove the most recent letter, but once you do you won't be able to get it back unless it comes back in the falling letters
- click enter to submit your word, you'll get a point for each letter

### Timed mode (tbc)

Try to get as many words before your time runs out!

### Life mode (tbc)

- you have three lives
- if you ~type a letter that isn't on the screen or~ submit a word that isn't recognised you'll lose a life

If you submit 4 invalid words, you lose!

_this probably isn't a great way to do it because my library might not be complete_




###### Game idea 2

Falling words, type in the whole word before it falls off the screen. Something about themes (related words = streak with x2/x3/xN pts? Or only type words related to a theme? Or only type words that are falling in a red bubble? Idk)
